#Spreading visualization
Just a way to see how things can spread very easily. The program start with one body "infected". Each "infected" are able to infect others healthy people.
I started by doing this in Python, but the UI kill itself when it reachs above 400 bodies. Unity is way more powerful, allowing me to add more than 4000 bodies.
